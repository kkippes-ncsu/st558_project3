    "section": "Summarizations",
    "text": "Summarizations\nNow we will explore summary statistics in the form of tables and plots for our chosen variables. We will look at each variable independently (univariate), and then we will look at each relationship between the explanatory variable and the response (bivariate).\n\nDiabetes\nFirst we will look at our response variable, diabetes, by itself. Below we find the proportion of the data has prediabetes/diabetes and the proportion that doesn’t.\n\ndiabetes_eda |&gt;\n  count(Diabetes) |&gt;\n  mutate(prop = n / sum(n))\n\n  Diabetes      n     prop\n1       No 218334 0.860667\n2      Yes  35346 0.139333\n\n\nIt is interesting to see that 86% of the survey responses indicated that they don’t have diabetes/prediabetes. This is a large imbalance and something that will have to be taken into consideration when selecting the most appropriate model.\n\n\nCholesterol\nNext we will look at cholesterol by itself and also it’s relationship with diabetes.\n\n## univariate\ndiabetes_eda |&gt;\n  count(HighChol) |&gt;\n  mutate(prop = n / sum(n))\n\n             HighChol      n      prop\n1 No High Cholesterol 146089 0.5758791\n2    High Cholesterol 107591 0.4241209\n\n## bivariate\ndiabetes_eda |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x = HighChol, fill = Diabetes)) +\n  geom_bar(position = \"fill\") +\n  labs(title = \"Diabetes Proportion by High/Not High Cholesterol\", y = \"Proportion\", fill = \"Diabetes\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLooking at cholesterol by itself shows that the survey responses are more evenly split with slightly more of the responses not having high cholesterol. However, when you breakdown cholesterol by diabetes status, we again see that there is a disproportion. Regardless of high cholesterol or not, more subjects do not have diabetes. Although, it is important to note that there is a higher proportion of diabetes when the subject also has high cholesterol.\n\n\nBMI\nThe below summarizes BMI. The first table and graph summarize BMI by itself. We can see that BMI ranges from 12 to 98 and the mean BMI is just above 28. Additionally, the BMI is right-shewed meaning that most data points fall to the left and that the mean is higher than the median.\nThe second table and plot look at the relationship between BMI and Diabetes. They both tell us that subjects with diabetes tend to have a higher BMI but they have the same range of BMIs. Also, grouping BMI by diabetes makes the distributions of BMI more normal than BMI by itself.\n\n## Univariate\n## summary table\nsummary(diabetes_eda$BMI)\n\n   Min. 1st Qu.

We observe that younger age groups have very low proportions of diabetes. As age increases, the proportion of those with diabetes also increases. 70-74 has the highest proportion of individuals with diabetes."
